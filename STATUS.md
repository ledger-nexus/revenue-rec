# Active Claude sessions — coordination scoreboard

**READ THIS BEFORE EDITING ANY FILE.** Multiple Claude sessions can
run concurrently in this workspace (context auto-fork on >50% usage,
or the user may launch parallel sessions intentionally). Without
coordination, parallel sessions clobber each other's writes.

The rule: **read this file first. Claim the files you'll touch.
Release on exit.** Other sessions defer to active claims.

---

## Active claims

<!--
Format for each claim — start a new ### block per session, never edit
someone else's:

### Session <short-id> · started <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> · heartbeat <HH:MM>
- **Scope**: one-line description of what this session is doing
- **Files / globs**: paths this session may write to
- **Branch**: git branch this session is on
- **Working dir**: absolute path (different from default if using a worktree)

Update your own heartbeat every ~20 turns. If your heartbeat is older
than 60 minutes, other sessions may consider your claim stale.
-->

_No active claims._

---

## Recent completions

<!--
When a session finishes work, move its block here with a final timestamp.
Keep the last ~10 entries; trim older ones to keep this file under 200 lines.

Example:

### Session <short-id> · YYYY-MM-DD (commit `<sha7>`)
- **Scope**: what shipped
- **Branch**: branch name (and whether merged/pushed)
- **Outcome**: one-line result
-->

### Session mirror-resync-rr · 2026-07-16 (commit `aff4664`)
- **Scope**: re-synced stale ledger-core schema mirror to main@9442667 (FK-closed); banned `db push`/`migrate dev`, added reviewed-diff `db:diff` protocol; docs updated
- **Branch**: `claude/mirror-resync` (pushed; PR #37 open against main)
- **Outcome**: db:diff = 0 statements vs mirrored/owned tables; tsc clean; 148/148 tests green; no DDL executed

## How to use this file

**At session start (every session, every time):**
1. Read this file
2. Look at active claims
3. If your task overlaps with an active claim, either:
   - Pick a different task
   - Wait for the other session to finish
   - Surface the conflict to the user before proceeding

**Before your first file edit:**
4. Append a `### Session <id>` block under "Active claims" with your
   scope + the files/globs you'll touch + your branch + working dir
5. Commit STATUS.md immediately (small atomic commit) so other
   sessions see your claim — uncommitted claims race with concurrent
   reads

**Every ~20 turns:**
6. Update your heartbeat timestamp in STATUS.md (also small atomic
   commit)

**At session end:**
7. Move your block to "Recent completions" with a final outcome line
8. Commit one last time

**If you see a stale claim** (heartbeat >60 min old):
- The owning session may have died; gently take over but log it
- Add a `~~strikethrough~~ stale per <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` note in
  their block

**Forbidden:**
- Editing another session's claim block (only the owner edits it)
- Skipping the read step
- Holding a claim on the entire repo (`**`) — break work into scoped
  chunks

## Why this works

The protocol is **soft + advisory**, not a hard lock. It works because:

1. **Visibility** — every session sees what every other session is
   doing
2. **Atomic small commits** — claims race-loose-but-don't-collide
   because git serializes commits. If two sessions try to claim at
   once, one's `git pull` shows the other's claim before the second
   writes
3. **Human arbitration** — when sessions DO collide, the user (one
   person driving N sessions) sees the conflict in the commit log
   and can manually coordinate
4. **Cheap** — no daemons, no Redis, no extra processes. Just a file
   + discipline encoded in CLAUDE.md

Hard locks (e.g. lockfile + fcntl) would be more robust but require
infrastructure. For ~5 self-reporting Claude sessions with one human
overseer, soft coordination is enough.
